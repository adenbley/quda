Version 0.3 - alpha

- Replaced all field with new ColorSpinorField object.  This will
  eventually evolve into a heterogeneous environment through the cpu
  and cuda implementations (and perhaps ocl?).

- Promoted the Dirac operators to classes.

- Blas performance improvements and slightly faster 8 reconstruction
  (single and half)

- Rewritten dslash_quda.cu using templates.  This breaks CUDA 2.3,
  QUDA now requires 3.0+.

Version 0.2 - 16 December 2009

- Introduced new interface functions newQudaGaugeParam() and
  newQudaInvertParam() to allow for enhanced error checking.  See
  invert_test for an example of their use.

- Added auto-tuning blas to improve performance (see README for details).

- Improved stability of the half precision 8-parameter SU(3)
  reconstruction (with thanks to Guochun Shi).

- Cleaned up the invert_test example to remove unnecessary dependencies.

- Fixed bug affecting saveGaugeQuda() that caused su3_test to fail.

- Tuned parameters to improve performance of the half-precision clover
  Dslash on sm_13 hardware.

- Formally adopted the MIT/X11 license.


Version 0.1 - 17 November 2009

- Initial public release.
